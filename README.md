# Internet Message Format

This project is a collection of utilities for parsing and manipulating internet
messages as defined by [RFC 5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322) and
related specifications. I started it as a test project to get familiar with
[Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec). So far is covers parsing
and formatting mailboxes, dates, most headers, message IDs, and full messages.
